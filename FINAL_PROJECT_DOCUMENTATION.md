## Features

- Responsive layout for desktop and mobile  
- Navigation bar across all pages  
- Services tab with image gallery  
- Contact form with basic validation

## Deployment Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/TaylorTayTray/plp-webtechnologies-classroom-july2025-july-2025-final-project-and-deployment-Final-Project-and-Depl.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
3. To deploy:
   - Push to the `main` or `master` branch  
   - Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings

## Challenges Faced

- Accidentally created a file named `images` instead of a folder  
- Git didn’t track the image folder due to missing files  
- Branch mismatch (`main` vs `master`) caused push errors

## Solutions Applied

- Deleted incorrect file and created proper folder structure  
- Used `git add images/` and verified image paths  
- Renamed branch using `git branch -M main` and pushed successfully

## Future Improvements

- Add animations and hover effects  
- Connect contact form to a backend service (e.g., Formspree or Firebase)  
- Improve accessibility with semantic tags and ARIA attributes
